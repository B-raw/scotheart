Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. By registering to use the HighSTEACS app, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this policy.</p>
            <p>For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”), the data controller is The University of Edinburgh, a charitable body registered in Scotland (registration number SC005336), incorporated under the Universities (Scotland) Acts.</p>

            <p>We will collect and process the following data about you, which you provide during the registration process: first name, last name, organisation, country, role, speciality.</p>
            <h4 class="text-center">Cookies and Google Analytics</h4>
            <p>This website uses Google Analytics to help analyse how visitors use this site. Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are small text files placed on your computer, to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information in an anonymous form. For more information see: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners" target="_blank">How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps</a>.</p>
            <h4 class="text-center">Uses made of the information</h4>
            <p>We use information held about you to provide the case logging function of the web app and associated functions, such as the recovery of a forgotten password. It will be associated with the patient data that you enter into the case log and this will be used for research and audit purposes (see “Patient Data” below). We may contact you in future to invite you to participate in further research, but you are under no obligation to respond. You may opt out of receiving emails for this purpose at any time by contacting <a href="mailto:info@highsteacs.com" target="_top">info@highsteacs.com</a>.</p>
            <h4 class="text-center">Where we store your personal data</h4>
            <p>The data that we collect from you will be transferred to, and stored at, a destination within the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It will also be processed by staff operating within the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. </p>
            <p>We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

            <h4 class="text-center">Access to Information</h4>
            <p>The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act.</p>
            <h4 class="text-center">Contact</h4>

            <p><strong>By registering for the HighSTEACS web app I agree to the use of my personal data as set out in the above policy.</strong></p>
            <h3 class="text-center">Patient Data</h3>
            <p>This web app also collects the anonymous patient data that is entered by the user. There is no possible or likely method of individual patients being re-identified from this data, and thus the data is fully anonymous and as such not subject to the Act.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, because of the sensitive nature of the data being collected, it will remain confidential and only be used for the purposes outlined below. Data is transmitted in encrypted format. Under no circumstances will we attempt to re-identify any individuals using this data in combination with any other data that may come into our possession.</p>
            <h4 class="text-center">Uses made of the information</h4>
            <p>The anonymous patient data will be used for research and audit purposes only. It will be used to analyse the performance of the HighSTEACS pathway in different healthcare settings around the world, the performance of the web app, and other analyses as determined appropriate by us.</p>
