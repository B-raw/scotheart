          This is a risk assessment calculator that has been developed from the <a href="/about">SCOT-HEART Study</a>. It shows how high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assays can be used to predict the likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease in patients referred for suspected angina, and compares this risk to <a href="/about" target="_blank">the current ESC guidelines</a>. It is a demonstration of the studyâ€™s  results (in review), is not intended or approved for clinical use and has not been reviewed or approved by the European Society of Cardiology.
