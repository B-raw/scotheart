            Use of the HighSTEACS web app (“the web app”) constitutes acceptance of these terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not use the web app.
            <br><br>This is a beta version of the HighSTEACS web app, which is still undergoing testing before its official release. The web app, its software and all content found on it are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. You are solely responsible for securing and backing up your content.
            <br><br>If you encounter any bugs, errors, lack of functionality or other problems on the web app, please let us know at <a href="mailto:info@highsteacs.com" target="_top">info@highsteacs.com</a> so we can rectify these as soon as possible. Your assistance in this would be greatly appreciated.
            <br><br>The web app is to be used to help clinicians learn about the HighSTEACS pathway and to help advance knowledge through research and audit. This pathway is for patients with chest pain and suspected acute myocardial infarction and has been developed using the Abbott high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay (1, 2).
            <br><br>It is the user’s responsibility to ensure they have obtained all necessary rights and consents to input patient data into the web app and by doing so you warrant that any such contribution does comply with these standards, and you will be liable to us and indemnify us for any breach of that warranty.
            <br><br>The web app has been designed to ensure that no identifiable data may be entered for patients. The users agrees not to enter any personal identifiable patient data into the web app or to send it to us via any means, or to otherwise use the web app in any way that identifies any third parties.
