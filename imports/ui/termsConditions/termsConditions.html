            <br><br>This is a beta version of the SCOT-HEART web app, which is still undergoing testing before its official release. The web app, its software and all content found on it are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. You are solely responsible for securing and backing up your content.

Your assistance in this would be greatly appreciated.
            <br><br>The web app is to be used to help clinicians learn about the potential role of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in the diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease (1) and should not be considered suitable for use as a diagnostic tool. <br><br>
