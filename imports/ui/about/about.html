          <p>The SCOT-HEART study is a prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled trial investigating the role of computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) in patients referred to a specialist clinic with suspected angina due to CHD. The study population comprised individuals from across Scotland who were randomised 1:1 to CTCA plus standard care or standard care alone. For the purposes of this analysis, 937 patients who underwent CTCA at a single centre had troponin concentrations measured with 2 high-sensitivity assays (Singulex Erenna and Abbott ARCHITECTSTAT) to determine the additive value of troponin when added to the existing Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Consortium risk model for determining the pre-test probability of obstructive CAD.</p>
          <p>The findings of the primary SCOT-HEART trial analysis were published in 2015 (The Lancet. 2015;385(9985):2383-91) and are available at: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60291-4" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60291-4</a></p>
          <p>The trial design was published in 2012 (Trials. 2012;13:184) and is available at: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1745-6215-13-184" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1186/1745-6215-13-184</a></p>

          <h2 class="text-center">European Society of Cardiology (ESC)</h2>
          <p>Following clinical assessment, the 2013 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for the management of stable coronary artery disease (Eur Heart J. 2013;34(38):2949-3003) recommend the use of the CAD Consortium risk model for determining the pre-test probability (PTP) of coronary artery disease. The results of this risk scoring are used to group patients into low, intermediate and high risk categories which can be used to guide decision making related to further testing.</p>
          <p>Intermediate risk patients (i.e. PTP between 15% and 85%) are likely to derive greatest diagnostic benefit from undergoing additional testing (e.g. functional ischaemia testing or anatomical assessment of coronary atherosclerosis with CTCA). This web app extends the CAD Consortium risk model by also including the results of high-sensitivity troponin testing with the aim of improving the accuracy of PTP estimation.</p>
          <p>It should be emphasised that this app is intended solely to demonstrate this scientific concept and should not be used for clinical decision making. The 2013 ESC guidelines are available <a href="https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Stable-Coronary-Artery-Disease-Management-of" target="_blank">here</a></p>
